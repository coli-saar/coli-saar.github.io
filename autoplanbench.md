## Abstract

LLMs are being increasingly used for planning-style tasks,
but their capabilities for planning and reasoning are poorly understood.
We present a novel method for automatically converting planning benchmarks written in PDDL
into textual descriptions and offer a benchmark dataset
created with our method.
We show that while the best LLM planners do well on many planning tasks,
others remain out of reach of current methods.
